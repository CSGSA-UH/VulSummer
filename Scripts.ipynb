Extended Description Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \\\"..\\\" and \\\"\\/\\\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \\\"..\\/\\\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \\\"\\/usr\\/local\\/bin\\\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal. In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack. For example, the software may add \\\".txt\\\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\"}\n",

This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism.

            "{\"CWE ID\":\"CWE-78\",\"CWE Name\":\"Improper Sanitization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\",\"Description\":\"Description SummaryThe software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not sanitize or incorrectly sanitizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component. Extended Description This could allow attackers to execute unexpected, dangerous commands directly on the operating system. This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process fails to follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage. There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:  1) The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\\\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\\\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing. 2) The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \\\"exec([COMMAND])\\\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.  From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\"}\n",
            "{\"CWE ID\":\"CWE-79\",\"CWE Name\":\"Failure to Preserve Web Page Structure ('Cross-site Scripting')\",\"Description\":\"Description SummaryThe software does not sufficiently validate, filter, escape, and encode user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. Extended Description Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request. 2. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data. 3. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc. 4. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data. 5. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain. 6. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.  There are three main kinds of XSS:  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.   Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.    Type 0: DOM-Based XSS In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.  Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \\\"drive-by hacking.\\\" In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\"}\n",

            "{\"CWE ID\":\"CWE-97\",\"CWE Name\":\"Failure to Sanitize Server-Side Includes (SSI) Within a Web Page\",\"Description\":\"Description SummaryThe software fails to adequately filter server-side include (control-plane) syntax from user-controlled input (data plane) and then allows potentially injected server-side includes to be acted upon.\"}\n",
            "{\"CWE ID\":\"CWE-98\",\"CWE Name\":\"Improper Control of Filename for Include\\/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP File Inclusion')\",\"Description\":\"Description SummaryThe PHP application receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in \\\"require,\\\" \\\"include,\\\" or similar functions. Extended Description In certain versions and configurations of PHP, this can allow an attacker to specify a URL to a remote location from which the software will obtain the code to execute. In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.\"}\n",
